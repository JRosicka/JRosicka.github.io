Hiya! I'm Joey Rosicka and I'm a software developer located in the Twin Cities area. 

Here you can find [**my portfolio**](https://www.joeyrosicka.com/projects) of game dev projects I've worked on, as well as various [**blog posts**](https://www.joeyrosicka.com/blog) based around a variety of topics ranging from game development to whatever is on my mind (editor's note: there are currently 0 "whatever is on my mind" posts).

If you want to get in touch, I can best be contacted via [**email**](mailto:joseph.erik.rosicka@gmail.com?Subject=Hello,%20Joey!).

One more thing - **this website is currently under construction.** So, there are probably quite a lot of sample posts and poorly-formatted things. Stay tuned.
